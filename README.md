 ## Project Overview
    In this project, we will establish what factors make a trending video on YouTube in an effort to advise potential YouTubers on the markers necessary to reach trending status. We hope to use the many different configurations of data to describe the qualities of a trending video.
    
 ## Project Notes/Questions
    - Does upload date effect whether a video is trending?(Can an old video still be considered trending)?
    - Does category effect returns? (returns = views)
    - How does a video reach the status of trending? How does it lost that status?
    - How do views, shares, likes, comments effect a video? Which has the strongest effect on making a video trending?
    - What data could have further impacted this project? Financial? Cost per Click? Gender/Demographic?

## Processes Used
    - Tableau will be used as our Dashboard
    - Sentimental analysis will be used on the Tags
    - SQL database
    - DB Tables will be View ID, Likes, Dislikes, etc.
    - Jupyter Notebook

## Data
This dataset includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos for USA. with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.


The dataset for the project is “Trending YouTube Videos Statistics”. (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) 
The dataset contains daily trending video list from 2017-11-14 to 2018-04-16, with data such as "video_id", "title", "channel_title", "trending_date", "publish_date", "views", "likes", "dislikes", "comment_count" and more.

We will be using time stamps, categories, views, likes and comments to establish a pattern among trending videos. Original data was cleaned of duplicates, URLs, and null values. 

The original dataset includes 2 different data for each regions:
- Category data which is in .json format. 
- Video data which is in .csv format.

For our project we decided to use the US region data.

### Missing Information
Things that would have helped our analysis and are missing from this dataset
* Demography -  gender, age
* Video Run time
