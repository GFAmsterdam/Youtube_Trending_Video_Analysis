# YouTube_Trending_Video_Analysis
 ## Project Overview
    In this project, we will establish what factors make a trending video on YouTube in an effort to advise potential YouTubers on the markers necessary to reach trending status. We hope to use the many different configurations of data to describe the qualities of a trending video.

 ## Data
    We will be using time stamps, categories, views, likes and comments to establish a pattern among trending videos
 ## Project Notes/Questions
    - Does upload date effect whether a video is trending?(Can an old video still be considered trending)?
    - Does category effect returns? (returns = views)
    - How does a video reach the status of trending? How does it lost that status?
    - How do views, shares, likes, comments effect a video? Which has the strongest effect on making a video trending?

## Processes Used
    - Tableau will be used as our Dashboard
    - Sentimental analysis will be used on the Tags
    - SQL database
    - Jupyter Notebook
