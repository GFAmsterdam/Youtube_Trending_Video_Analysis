## Project Overview
The first week we are working on outlining the project and come up with an objective and questions we could answer regarding the project. 

In an advertising perspective we are trying to figure out what in a video is making it the most popular on Youtube. (Cracking the Youtube Algorithm) 

## Data
This dataset includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos for USA. with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.


### Missing Information
Things that would have helped our analysis and are missing from this dataset
* Demography -  gender, age
* Video Run time

# Notes to keep track (Project Progress)

* Decided to use Sentimental analysis on the tags.
* Factors influencing the popularity the views, likes, category etc.
* Tables for the database. - View ID, Like and Dislikes and table link. (Have a data flow chart - to link separate tables)
* To separate the publish date and time, rearrange the order to have the publish time first. 
* Dashboard - Tableau to be used.
